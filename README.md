Source code for the Typst Improved Tables Planning document

## NOTE

This work was part of the "More Flexible Tables" initiative in Typst (see https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/3001) and has been concluded. Some features were left for later, such as subheaders and subfooters (https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5375) and might still be worked on independently.

No further changes are planned to this document, which remains public for archiving purposes.
